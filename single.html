<h2 id="goal">Description</h2>
<p>Sometimes there are talks which do not fit into a series. This page serves to collect these talks, and their descriptions.
<h3>Castelnuovo's contractibility theorem</h3>
<p>We will cover some aspects of the birational geometry of surfaces.

<h3>Greenlees&ndash;May duality</h3>
<p>We will give an introduction to the homological algebra of formal schemes, by discussing the Greenlees-May duality over commutative noetherian rings.</p>
<p>For some background, see <a href="#alonso">[1]</a> and <a href="#shaul">[2]</a>.

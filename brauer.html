<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this seminar is to introduce Brauer groups of rings and schemes, and prove Gabber's theorem (in the version of de Jong) that $\mathrm{Br}(X)=\mathrm{Br}'(X)$ provided $X$ has an ample line bundle.

<p>The Brauer group has a long history: over a field $k$ one can consider central simple algebras, which are nice noncommutative algebras that are closely related to the arithmetic properties of $k$. Under an appropriate equivalence relation these form an abelian group, and this group is an important invariant of a field coinciding with the Galois cohomology of the absolute Galois group of $k$.

<p>On a scheme the correct analogue of Galois cohomology is given by &eacute;tale cohomology with coefficients in $\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}}$, whereas central simple algebras become Azumaya algebras, and one can show that there is a chain of inclusions
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Br}(X)\hookrightarrow\mathrm{Br}'(X)=\mathrm{H}_{\text{et}}^2(X,\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}})_{\mathrm{tors}}\hookrightarrow\mathrm{H}_{\text{et}}^2(X,\mathbb{G}_{\mathrm{m}})
\end{equation}
Knowing that the first inclusion is an equality is an important property of a scheme $X$: on one hand it allows to study geometric objects (Azumaya algebras) using purely cohomological techniques, whilst on the other hand one has an explicit geometric description of abstractly defined cohomology classes.

<p>This seminar can also serve as the basis for a follow-up seminar on orders next semester, for which a good understanding of Brauer groups of varieties and their function fields is important.

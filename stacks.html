<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>We read Olsson's preprint Algebraic spaces and stacks [<a href="#olsson-book">1</a>], and try to get well-versed in the lingo of algebraic spaces and stacks, and understand (derived) categories of quasi-coherent sheaves on them.
<p>I will try to add references at some point. For now, the Stacks project has a <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03B0">long list of references</a>. Some that I find particularly interesting are [<a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/bibliography/kresch_geometry">kresch_geometry</a>, <a href="http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/bibliography/olsson_sheaves">olsson_sheaves</a>, ...] and not contained in the references list there I like [<a href="#functorial-formalism">2</a>, ...].
<p>If you feel like it, you can propose to explain something extra about the stuff we have read. E.g. outline some of the results from EGA that are used, or explain something more about cohomological descent, or discuss more Grothendieck topologies on the category of schemes, ...
<p>We meet Wednesdays, at 1 o'clock.

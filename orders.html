<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>This semester the seminar will be organized more along the lines of a reading group: first we discuss a part of the text that we read at home, then someone gives a lecture about what follows. We will repeat this a few times whilst working through Chan's <a href="http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~danielch/Lect_Orders.pdf">Lectures on orders</a>.
<p>Once this is done we will take a look the special case of (maximal orders) on curves and surfaces. We will discuss Artin's conjecture (which is the analogue of the Enriques--Kodaira classification for smooth projective surfaces) and the notion of weighted noncommutative curves. An important reference will be Artin--de Jong's <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/courses/711/ordersms-num.pdf">Stable orders over surfaces</a>.

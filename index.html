<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>What?
  <dd>ANAGRAMS is an acronym for <em>Antwerp Algebraic Geometry, Rings and More Seminar</em>.
  <dd>As the silly name indicates, it is a (graduate student) seminar on topics related to the research areas that the algebra and geometry group of the University of Antwerp (and Brussels, and Hasselt) specialises in: noncommutative algebra, algebraic geometry, noncommutative geometry, quadratic forms, ...
  <dd>The goal is to <em>learn things</em>, not present new results.

  <dt>Where?
  <dd>Room G.016, Campus Middelheim, University of Antwerp

  <dt>When?
  <dd>Friday mornings, at 11h00. Feel free to join some subset of the participants afterwards for lunch.
  <dd>Check the <a href="#schedule">schedule</a> to see whether there is a lecture.

  <dt>Who?
  <dd>The lectures are given by PhD students (or postdocs). The intended audience consists of interested Master and PhD students and postdocs.

  <dt>How?
  <dd>Each session of talks takes 2 hours (this is not set in stone). One person gives a 2-hour talk, there could be two 1-hour talks, or several short talks, depending on the subject. Talks are done in English.
  <dd>The seminar will mostly consist of series of lectures on a single subject. The actual number may vary depending on the subject.

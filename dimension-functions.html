<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>There is a myriad of dimension functions in (homological) algebra, geometry and the theory of quadratic forms. There is no well-defined notion of dimension function, but let's say it is a numerical invariant of a ring, module or field. The goal would be to discuss some of these, and wherever applicable show how they are related.

<p>The format of this seminar is different from the others:
<ul>
  <li>talks are somewhere between 15 minutes and 1 hour
  <li>people can give several talks (or discuss several related dimensions at once)
  <li>mostly definitions and facts, no difficult proofs
  <li>provide pointers to the literature
</ul>

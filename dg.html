<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>Nowadays it is hard to not encounter the terminology differential graded (or dg) in algebra or algebraic geometry. By discussing some of the already classical articles (Keller, Drinfel'd, ToÃ«n, Tabuada) we would like to get an overview of some of the motivating reasons for using dg categories, and relate them to triangulated categories.

<p>Remark that May 2 and May 30 the university is closed, and there will not be a seminar on June 6. There is one planned speaker for June 13 or June 20 (more information later), feel free to propose a talk for the other slot.

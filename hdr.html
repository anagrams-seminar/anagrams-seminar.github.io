<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of the seminar is to come to an understanding of the proof by Deligne and Illusie of the <em>degeneration of the Hodge-to-de Rham spectral sequence</em>. The setup is as follows: let $k$ be a field, $X$ a smooth and proper scheme over $k$, then one can compute algebraic de Rham cohomology on one hand, and sheaf cohomology of the sheaves $\Omega_{X/k}^p$ on the other. These are related by means of a spectral sequence
\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{E}_1^{p,q}=\mathrm{H}^q(X,\Omega_{X/k}^p)\Rightarrow\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{dR}}^{p+q}(X/k).
\end{equation}
<p>When $k=\mathbb{C}$ one can use techniques from complex analytic geometry, such as the Poincar&eacute; lemma and Hodge theory. It took until 1987 to find a purely algebraic proof. This proof is very interesting, because it combines techniques from characteristic $p$, deformation theory, algebraic geometry and derived categories to come to an important result.
